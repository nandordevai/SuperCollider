# SuperCollider

[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) experiments

- `composition_001`: generative MIDI sequencer patterns to be used with Ableton Live
- `MIDI`: some basic MIDI stuff
- `Patterns`: sequencing & TouchOSC code for synthdefs
- `SynthDefs`: simple synth definitions, mostly physical modeling
- `TouchOSC layouts`
- `ableton-link-poc.scd`: Ableton Link proof of concept implementation
- `random-seq.scd`: first try at random/generative sequencing, see `composition_001` files for a more advanced approach

Also see [LCXLKontrol](https://github.com/nandordevai/LCXLKontrol) for my implementation of Novation LaunchControl XL MIDI mapping.
